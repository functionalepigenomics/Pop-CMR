This repository contains codes codes to reproduce the results and figures published in the paper.

"Distinct Co-Methylation Patterns in African and European Populations and Their Genetic Associations"

### :computer: Repository Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

- Figure: This folder contains codes for generating the main figures.

- Permuation: This folder contains scripts for the permutation analysis.

- Transcription: This folder contains codes for transcriptional analysis.

- WGBS: This folder contains scripts related to analyzing DNA methyaltion in whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) data.

- mQTL: This folder stores codes for the identification of methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTLs).
